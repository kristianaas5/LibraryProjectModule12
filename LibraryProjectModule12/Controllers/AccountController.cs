/// AccountControler class is responsible for handling user registration, login, and logout functionalities. It uses ASP.NET Core Identity to manage user accounts and roles. The controller includes actions for displaying registration and login forms, processing form submissions, and ensuring that necessary roles are created in the system. It also handles access denial scenarios for unauthorized users.

By injecting UserManager<ApplicationUser> into the controller, we can perform operations related to user management, such as creating new users during registration and assigning roles to users.
    private readonly SignInManager<ApplicationUser> _signInManager;// The SignInManager is another service provided by ASP.NET Core Identity that handles user sign-in and sign-out operations. By injecting SignInManager<ApplicationUser> into the controller, we can manage user authentication, including signing in users after successful registration or login, and signing out users when they choose to log out of the application.
    private readonly RoleManager<IdentityRole> _roleManager;// The RoleManager is a service provided by ASP.NET Core Identity that allows us to manage roles in the application. By injecting RoleManager<IdentityRole> into the controller, we can create and manage roles, such as "Admin" and "User", which can be assigned to users to control access to different parts of the application based on their roles.
